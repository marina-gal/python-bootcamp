Day 5 - Password Generator
The programm asks the user the number of letters, numbers and symbols they want in their password, and generates a random combination with those characteristics.

First option: it concatenates the characters in order (first letters, then symbols and then numbers)

Applied concepts:

        random.choice(), random.radint(), random.shuffle()
        append()
        loops, range()
        input()
